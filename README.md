# DataStructures
This repository contains my solutions to the tasks that I had to solve during the "Data structures and time complexity" classes.  

## Project list  

### Graphs  
This project contains two implementations of storing a directed, weighted graph in memory. These include an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list.
Performance of algorithms using two methods is tested.
  
### Priority Queue
This project has been done to implement two ways of keeping a priority queue. The first one uses a circular buffer in a regular array while the second utilizes a doubly linked list. Performance of adding and deleting operations on both data structures is examined.
  
### Binary Heap
The project uses two methods to implement a binary heap - both using an array and a pointers-based binary tree. Efficiency of heap sort on these two structures is compared against an STL algorithm.

## Setup
**Clone the repository and use Code::Blocks IDE to run project files.**
